# SpamBot
### Annoy your friends and the like.

Okay this is just a pretty simple script I wrote to spam someone on WhatsApp. It's pretty straight forward but I'll explain how to use it and the few caveats.

## Installation

* Install python (duh) from https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Download the spam.py and requirements.txt or just clone the repo. 
* Run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in your terminal.
* Execute the script with ```python spam.py``` or just double click the file.

Enter the inputs after the console prompts you and scan the QR code when WhatsApp Web pops up.

## The caveats

* You'll have to scan the QR code again for every person you want to spam.
* You'll have to make sure your victim is in your top 10 recent chats. Web scraping is annoying okay.
* No, I'm not planning on making this any better. Hmu (vanajmoorthy@gmail.com) if this doesn't work for you.

Your friends should be sufficiently annoyed.
