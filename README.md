# SpamBot
### Annoy your friends and the like.

Okay this is just a pretty simple script I wrote to spam someone on WhatsApp. It's pretty straight forward but I'll explain how to use it and the few caveats.

* Download the single spam.py file. 
* Install Selenium with ```pip install selenium```
* Install Webdriver-Manager with ```pip install webdriver-manager```
* Execute the script with ```python spam.py``` or just double click the file.

Enter the inputs after the console prompts you and scan the QR code when WhatsApp Web pops up.

Your friends should be sufficiently annoyed.
